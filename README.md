# JLU evv mini-Scraper
 Clientside Scraper for the "Elektronisches Vorlesungsverzeichnis" of the Justus-Liebig-University Gie√üen

You can view the app here: [Link to github.io](https://thhaase.github.io/JLU-evv-Scraper/) it just takes an eternety to work because the app is hosted clientside. 
If you want to host your own shinyapp clientside you can access my tutorial here: [Shiny-Netflix App via Github Pages (https://github.com/thhaase/R_Clientside_Shiny_Netflix_History/blob/main/README.md) 

## Better way to use the mini-scraper
I recommend downloading and using the "script_with_wich_i_made_the_app.R". 
If you don't know much of R but have it installed anyways (wich I also recommend) download the app/app.R and ask a friend to start it for you:D
